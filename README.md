Both, PHP's [strftime()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php#refsect1-function.strftime-parameters) and [date()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php#refsect1-function.date-parameters) formats are supported.

## Header and Footer Items

Sometimes it is required to add custom Javascript or CSS to one or more pages. This could be for example the case if you would want to add a Google Analytics tracking snippet to your site. Therefore this theme provides two variables for that purpose. The itemsHeader variable lets you add all kind of header items right before the closing `</head>` tag. To add any HTML or JS right before the closing `</body>` tag you can use the itemsFooter variable.

| Name | Description |

| Items Header | Items to be inserted before the closing `</head>` tag. |
| Items Footer | Items to be inserted before the closing `</body>` tag. |

## Slideshows

As described before, it is either possible to used the block editor or the traditional Markdown editor to create content. Since the markdown editor is not able to create content like a slideshow, there are two separate variables available for project pages and posts to insert a slideshow right after the teaser when using Markdown.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Images Slideshow | One or more glob patterns to define the images showing up in the slideshow. |
| Slideshow Height | The relative height of the slideshow depending on the width. |
